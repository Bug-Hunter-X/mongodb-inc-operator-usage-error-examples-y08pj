# MongoDB $inc Operator Usage Error

This example demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB to increment a field's value.  The issue arises from providing a non-numeric value, or attempting to increment a field that does not already exist.

## Bug
The provided code snippet incorrectly attempts to increment a field that might not exist or uses an incorrect value.  This can lead to errors and unpredictable results.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the field exists and has a numeric value before attempting to increment it using $inc.  This can be achieved by using the `$setOnInsert` operator in combination with `$inc` or pre-checking and handling the scenario where the field doesn't exist.
